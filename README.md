# OSBot-AWS

![Current Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/release-v2.37.16-blue)

Large number of AWS apis and utils from the OWASP Security Bot (OSBot) which make
the use of AWS's boto3 library easier and more intuitive.

## Current version is 2.x.x 

This version has a number of breaking changes, mainly on the location of the apis, 
since we are moving into a specific folder per service (e.g. S3, SQS, etc)
